For the INFO 6350 final project, we have built a booking reservations and rating system for comedy clubs in the country. Since there is no platform online that exclusively caters to comedy fans that want to go watch their favorite comedians perform at comedy clubs nearby. We want to build a system where comedy fans, comedy club owners, and comedians can interact using this iOS app.

New and upcoming comedians can feature themselves in the lineups at various comedy clubs around the country. Comedy club owners can post new events and lineups and monetize their events by advertising deals on food and drinks. This is not limited to established comedy clubs, any bar or restaurant in the US can temporarily host stand-up events and support local artists.

On the other hand, comedy fans can book a reservation for said event and receive a QR code for the event. Only after getting their QR codes scanned at the venue can these fans rate the comedian and the venue itself. They can also buy food and drinks in advance just as it works in movie theaters(for example:- buy a pass for unlimited drinks in advance).

Below are the details and specifications of the app we are building -

1. NoSQL Database
2. Map Kit
3. OAuth Authentication
4. Payment Gateway
5. Email services for the order confirmation
6. Multi-user data(Client and Performer)
7. SwiftUI
